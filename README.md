Hello-world 
I've been working on this damn lab for the past hour and been frustrated as hell ! 
So I just had to put on my BOSE Headphones on and slow down.

Now I'm going farther in this and it's not going as fast as I want  it to . 
Did I skip steps ? 
I don't know but let's see. 

Fuuuuuuuuuuuu I'm not following intstructions 
What did you expect?! You knew this was going to happen.


And I did it after all that pain and suffering !
